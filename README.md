#  COVID-19 Global Data Analysis

This project explores global trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination efforts using data from **Our World in Data**. Through data cleaning, visualization, and analysis, it highlights insights about the pandemic's progression across countries and regions.

---

## Objectives

- Import and clean COVID-19 global data
- Analyze time-based trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Compare pandemic metrics across countries and continents
- Visualize data using clear and informative charts/maps
- Communicate key findings and insights in a Jupyter Notebook report

---

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) – data manipulation
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) – basic plotting
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) – enhanced visualizations
- [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) *(optional)* – for choropleth maps
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/) – numeric computations

## Key Insights
Countries like India experienced multiple waves with sharp spikes in cases and deaths.

High-income countries showed faster vaccination rollout, especially in early 2021.

Some countries had disproportionately high case fatality rates, often tied to healthcare system capacity or reporting standards.

## Reflections
This project was a great exercise in:

Real-world data cleaning and exploration

Understanding global disparities in healthcare response

Building visual storytelling through data

Using Python tools effectively for public health analysis
